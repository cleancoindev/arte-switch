# FAQ

## Does ARTE V1/V2 still have a function?

## Is arte V2 a fork?

## Are you supporting ARTE V1/V2? 
Nope. The DFOhub team will longer support ARTE V1/V2 both technically or formally after august 15, 2020. Since the Switch, we haven’t provided any liquidity for it on Uniswap, and we kindly recommend that you switch your ARTE V1/V2 to arte V3 ASAP.

Nope. The ARTE V3 Smart Contract will continue working as a regular ERC20, but it’s no longer connected to or usable by ethart’s DFO.
